If we are in a Multi-AZ, multi-region database we have double coverage. This means that the answer is

Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 0 minutes.
Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 0 minutes.
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: 0 minutes.
Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 0 minutes.

If one AZ is down, the active db continues to use the second AZ. So this should be no problem at all for RTO and RPO.
If one region is down and the data is other regions, also no data is lost as the data is synced to the other region.

Dependending on the application and how the application is implemented that is accessing the the database, there might
be a delay with switching the region, but that is in a way out of scope.
